The following is a class called VectorDatabase, we would like to improve it, while keeping the functionality the same.
The code is followed by a work plan/guide to improve it.
```python

class VectorDatabase:
	def __init__(self, n_consumers, num_results, n_vecs_per_consumer, emb_dim):
		"""
		initializes `num_consumers` empty vector databases, where each database represents a specific customer.
		It also takes `num_results`, `n_vecs_per_consumer` and `emb_dim` as arguments.
		"""
		self.customers = n_consumers
		self.num_results = num_results
		self.vecs_per_consumer = n_vecs_per_consumer
		self.databs = [Database(emb_dim, n_vecs_per_consumer) for _ in range(n_consumers)]
		self.dim = emb_dim

	  

	def batch_reset(self, consumer_ids_to_delete):

		"""
		takes a list of consumer IDs and reinitializes the corresponding databases. This is akin to clearing all data related to a specific customer.

	def batch_insert(self, key_vectors, value_vectors):
		"""

	def batch_query(self, query_vectors):
		"""

# Executing Queries on Multiple Databases: A Comprehensive Guide

This comprehensive guide outlines the methodology and corresponding pseudocode implementation to facilitate multiple queries across multiple databases. This guide presents the objectives, requirements, and specific execution steps, addressing both common and unique edge cases associated with the process. The key operations of the process are featured, and potential challenges, particularly those arising from managing concurrent queries, are highlighted with their proposed solutions.

## Objectives 

The primary objectives of this process encompass:

1. Facilitating searches relevant to managing conversational history across multiple databases.
2. Enabling queries across multiple database collections via a single call to a vector database.
3. Facilitating on-premise batch processing without reliance on API calls, employing available computational resources and on-premise databases.

## Required Resources

To realize the aforementioned objectives, the following resources and tools are required:

1. A suitable model for handling conversational history.
2. A vector database to be used for storing and querying embeddings. FAISS is an example of such a database.
3. Adequate infrastructure to support batch processing.

## Core Execution Steps

The entire process is structured into five fundamental steps:

### 1. Data Preparation 

This step involves converting each customer's conversational histories into appropriate embeddings. The resulting data are stored in separate collections within the vector database, with each collection representing a different customer.

### 2. Batch Processing 

This step consists of preparing the requests in batches and converting them to the same format as previously applied.

### 3. Database Query 

Embeddings relevant to the conversational history are retrieved by executing queries on each customer's collection stored in the vector database, all at once.

### 4. Processing Results

The system or model processes the retrieved embeddings, generating responses based on the given context.

### 5. Updating and Storing 

Newly generated data are stored back in their respective collections for future queries.

Querying multiple collections simultaneously in the vector database could potentially be time-consuming and may impact the system's performance. It would thus be prudent to optimize the vector database to enhance its speed. 

By implementing these steps, several challenges regarding processing multiple databases in a single data structure and managing latency and performance can be comprehensively addressed:

- **Unified Data Structure**: Ensure the creation of a universally applicable data structure, where each unique key corresponds to a customer's ID and the value represents their respective array.
- **Batch Processing**: Process a batch of requests relevant to all customers.
- **Data Partitioning**: Assign the batch of processed data to the corresponding customers based on their respective ID. Utilize this partitioned batch specifically for querying each customer's collection.
- **Concurrent Queries**: Implement multi-threading or asynchronous programming to enable simultaneous querying of individual customer collections. The retrieved data should be stored in temporary data structures linked to the respective customer's ID.
- **Result Aggregation**: Upon receipt of the processed data, reintegrate them back into a centralized data structure associated with their respective customer's ID.
- **Store and Update**: Incrementally update the centralized data structure with the newly processed data to minimize writing operations on the database.

Together, these steps provide a simplified approach to managing latency and performance-related challenges, while enabling the seamless extraction of data from multiple databases.

After completion of the procedural steps and addressing potential challenges, the next critical stage of the process is represented by the creation of a pseudo-code interface to handle multiple queries across multiple databases. This is instrumental in managing concurrent queries.

With a clear understanding of the steps involved in coordinating the tasks and managing potential challenges, it is important to now move towards implementing the system architecture.

# Comprehensive Implementation Plan for Batch Vector DB

## System Architecture

The architecture is composed of a central work queue, a fixed-size thread pool, and multiple customer databases. The central work queue houses all queries that need processing. Each query stored in the work queue carries metadata including `(query, customer_id, conversation_length)`.

## Thread Pool Management

Threads are managed via `ThreadPoolExecutor` in Python, or by using Cythonâ€™s `prange` for parallel execution, depending on the preferred implementation. The ideal number of threads to initialize is based on the hardware capabilities of the system.

## Work Queue Management

The central work queue is organized using a Python `Queue` or a Cython array, each task sorted by `conversation_length`. Edge cases such as handling empty queries are accounted for in the design, allowing for graceful management.

## Task Processing

Upon initialization, each thread receives a local `deque` (double-ended queue in Python) or local Cython array, populated with tasks from the central queue based on balance across total `conversation_length`. Threads process tasks by calling the relevant database's API functions.

## Result Aggregation

As threads complete tasks, they post results into a thread-safe data structure such as a `Queue` or `list` with a `threading.Lock` in Python, or a Cython array, using atomic memory operations for thread safety. Special precautions are taken to anticipate exceptions and manage potential result mismatches across databases.

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling measures are put in place for scenarios like simultaneous failure for multiple customer databases, query failures, or database-API exception handling.

## Thread Safety

Thread safety is rigorously implemented using `threading.Lock` in Python, or Cython's atomic operations and optional lower-level C-lock access, as required.


## Managing any Identified Edge Cases

Several potential edge cases are addressed, including:

- Query dependencies across databases: Employ checks and mechanisms to deal with issues of query sequence and dependency.
- Handling transient query failures: Mechanisms for query retries are implemented.
- Rollback from failed modifications: Introduce rollback mechanisms in the event of a query failure which modifications to a database.
- Database connection pooling: Manage scenarios where a database's max connection limit is reached.

## Resource Cleanup

Graceful and complete resource release measures are created for scenarios of thread termination.

## Advanced Considerations

Additional advanced edge cases are considered to add robustness to the system:

- Hardware failures: Establish contingencies for failures in dependent hardware such as GPUs.
- Database unresponsiveness or rate-limiting: Insert fallback mechanisms and recourses for handling slow or non-responsive databases.
- System startup issues: Manage edge cases arising during system bootstrapping or initialization.
- Batch failure: Determine shutdown thresholds in the event of comprehensive batch failures.
- Partial result handling: Manage cases where databases return results inconsistently.

## Problem specific edge cases
Each system or algorithm has specific edge cases that must be addressed in order to create a robust and accurate implementation. The following edge cases have been identified:

### Empty Queries
Given that a batch of queries could come out empty, there is a necessity to handle this elegantly. A robust solution needs to avoid crashing or throwing unnecessary errors in such cases.

### Data Integrity
Because tasks are being moved around, it's crucial to ensure that no data is lost or inaccurately duplicated in the process. Thorough checks and validation mechanisms are necessary to maintain data integrity across all queries and metadata.


### Database Engagement
There will be circumstances where a specific customer's database is temporarily unavailable or locked. The mechanism uses retries and rerouting to ensure that this does not disrupt the overall system efficiency and allows the database to function as soon as it becomes available again.

### Exception and Error Handling
Queries may fail or throw exceptions. The mechanism handles these gracefully without affecting the entire batch of queries, ensuring that individual query failures do not inhibit the overall function of the system.


### System Resource Constraints
The system also handles conditions where system resources such as memory or CPU are insufficient for the given tasks. By regulating task allocation and dynamically adjusting the workload, the system operates smoothly within the limits of these resource constraints.

### Result Ordering
To maintain a consistent user experience, the system ensures that the final result set is collected in the order it was expected, regardless of the order in which queries were processed.

### Graceful Shutdown and Cleanup
Finally, the system considers the release of resources and halting of threads. Once all queries have been processed and results aggregated, the thread pool is gracefully shut down and resources are released in a structured manner.

### Long-Running Queries
If there are queries that take an unusually long time to process, these edge cases are managed either by timed handling or by allocating them to a dedicated thread to prevent them from monopolizing resources. 

### Overflow and Underflow Conditions
Overflow and underflow conditions for queue or array are checked and managed effectively to avoid the disruption of the system.

These edge cases, while seemingly small, can pose significant disruption if not suitably addressed. Therefore, systematic identification and incorporation of these cases amplify the reliability and robustness of the system.


The `VectorDatabase` Cython implementation involves translating Python syntax into a Cython-friendly format. Variables need to have explicit type information and tasks must be defined as Cython struct. The biggest change comes in the worker function: instead of using Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, we'll be using Cython's `prange()`.

Here's an example implementation:
```python
import numpy as np

class Database:
    def __init__(self, emb_dim):
        self.emb_dim = emb_dim
        self.keys = np.zeros((0, emb_dim))
        self.values = np.zeros((0, emb_dim))

    def add(self, key_vector, value_vector):
        self.keys = np.vstack([self.keys, key_vector])
        self.values = np.vstack([self.values, value_vector])

    def query(self, query_vector, num_results):
        dot_products = np.dot(self.keys, query_vector)
        sorted_indices = np.argsort(dot_products)[::-1]
        closest_indices = sorted_indices[:num_results]
        return self.values[closest_indices]

```
